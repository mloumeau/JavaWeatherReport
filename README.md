#JavaWeatherReport


# Overview

This program uses openweathermap.org to display weather conditions in a user-inputted city.

It will only work on my machine since it deals with an APPID. However if a local key is acquired, it will work.

The program runs on a do-while loop to provide as many opportunities as the user would like. The program also always for the user to store the data in a txt file of there choosing. It allows for creating a new txt file, or appending onto an old one. Exception handling is done throughout.


I wrote this software as an introduction to Java. I wanted to get to learn the language and thought this project would be beneficial.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I installed Eclipse as my IDE since I read it was of good quality.

The libraries I used:

org.json.*
java.text.*
java.util.*
java.io.*
java.net.HttpURLConnection
java.net.URL

The only library that wasn't built in was the org.json. I had to download that and import the SDK.
